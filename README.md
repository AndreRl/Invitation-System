General
-----------

This plugin replaces MyBB's own Referral System. Advanced Invitation System allows you not only to hand out invitation codes, but also create a referee's account on their behalf using a **brand-new** tool called Quick Registration.

Bugs, Suggestions and Comments
-----------
All of the above are welcome. If you have a suggestion feel free to submit a pull request detailing the feature you may want to see in the next plugin update. We hate bugs don't we? If you find a bug or something you feel that shouldn't be there, please do create an issue so I can look over it. Any comments can be made to me directly via MyBB's forum, [here](https://community.mybb.com/user-87056.html).
